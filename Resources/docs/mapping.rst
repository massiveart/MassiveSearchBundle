Mapping
=======

The MassiveSearchBundle requires that you define which objects should be indexed
through *mapping*. Currently only **XML mapping** is natively supported:

.. code-block:: xml

    <!-- /path/to/YourBundle/Resources/config/massive-search/Product.xml -->
    <massive-search-mapping xmlns="http://massiveart.com/schema/dic/massive-search-mapping">

        <mapping class="Massive\Bundle\SearchBundle\Tests\Resources\TestBundle\Entity\Product">
            <index value="product" />
            <id property="id" />
            <fields>
                <field name="title" type="string" />
                <field name="body" type="string" />
            </fields>
        </mapping>

    </massive-search-mapping>

This mapping will cause the fields ``title`` and ``body`` to be indexed into
an index named ``product`` and the ID obtained from the objects ``id`` field.

Mapping elements
----------------

The possible mappings are:

- **index**: Name of the index in which to insert the record
- **title**: Title to use in search results
- **description**: A description for the search result
- **url**: The URL to which the search result should link to
- **image**: An image to associate with the search result
- **fields**: List of ``<field />`` elements detailing which fields should be
  indexed (i.e. used when finding search results).

Each mapping can use either a ``property``, ``expr`` attribute or an ``value``
attribute. These attributes determine how the value is retrieved. ``property``
will use the Symfony `PropertyAccess`_ component, and ``expr`` will use
`ExpressionLanguage`_. ``value`` is the easiest one, which just uses the
literal value passed.

PropertyAccess allows you to access properties of an object by path, e.g.
``title``, or ``parent.title``. The expression allows you to build expressions
which can be evaluated, e.g. ``'/this/is/' ~ object.getId() ~ '/a/path'``.

Fields
------

Fields dictate which fields are indexed in the underlying search engine.

Mapping:

- ``name``: Field name
- ``property``: Object property to map the field
- ``expr``: Mutually exclusive with ``property``

Types:

- ``string``: Store as a string
- ``complex``: Apply mapping to an array of values

Additionally you can define your own types with custom converters (see
:doc:`extending`). These converters convert the value into a indexable
format (currently string or array).

Complex mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complex mapping provides a way to map a nested data structure within the
subject object.

.. note::

    This feature is not currently supported by the XML driver and is therefore
    not available unless used in a custom driver.

Expression Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MassiveSearchBundle includes its own flavor of the Symfony expression
language.

.. code-block:: xml

    <massive-search-mapping xmlns="http://massiveart.com/schema/dic/massive-search-mapping">
        <mapping class="Massive\Bundle\SearchBundle\Tests\Resources\TestBundle\Entity\Product">
            <!-- ... -->
            <url expr="'/path/to/' ~ object.getTitle()'" />
            <!-- ... -->
        </mapping>
    </massive-search-mapping>

Processed entity is passed to the expression evaluator as `object` variable.

Functions:

- ``join``: Maps to the ``implode`` function in PHP. e.g. ``join(',', ["one",
  "two"])`` equals ``"one,two"``
- ``map``: Maps to the ``array_map`` function in PHP. e.g. ``map([1, 2, 3],
  'el + 1')`` equals ``array(2, 3, 4)``.

Localization
------------

You can add a ``locale`` mapping which will cause the object to be stored in a
localized index (if configured, see :doc:`localization`).

.. code-block:: xml

    <!-- /path/to/YourBundle/Resources/config/massive-search/Product.xml -->
    <massive-search-mapping xmlns="http://massiveart.com/schema/dic/massive-search-mapping">

        <mapping class="Massive\Bundle\SearchBundle\Tests\Resources\TestBundle\Entity\Product">
            <!-- ... -->
            <locale property="locale" />
            <!-- ... -->
        </mapping>

    </massive-search-mapping>

This assumes that the object has a property ``$locale`` which contiains the
objects current localization code.

If you do not map the ``locale`` or the ``locale`` is reosolved as ``NULL``
then it will be assumed that the object is not localized.

Reindexing
----------

When reindexing your data using the :ref:`command_search_index_rebuild`
command, you may not want to always reindex *all* of the entities in the
database, for example you may want to limit the search results only to
entities updated within the last 30 days.

You can specify a specific method to use on the repository as follows:

.. code-block:: xml

    <!-- /path/to/YourBundle/Resources/config/massive-search/Product.xml -->
    <massive-search-mapping xmlns="http://massiveart.com/schema/dic/massive-search-mapping">

        <mapping class="Massive\Bundle\SearchBundle\Tests\Resources\TestBundle\Entity\Product">
            <!-- ... -->
            <reindex repository-method="findForLast30Days" />
        </mapping>

    </massive-search-mapping>

Full example
------------

The following example uses all the mapping options:

.. code-block:: xml

    <!-- /path/to/YourBundle/Resources/config/massive-search/Product.xml -->
    <massive-search-mapping xmlns="http://massiveart.com/schema/dic/massive-search-mapping">

        <mapping class="Massive\Bundle\SearchBundle\Tests\Resources\TestBundle\Entity\Product">
            <reindex repository-method="findOnlySomethings" />
            <index value="product" />
            <id property="id" />
            <locale property="locale" />
            <title property="title" />
            <url expr="'/path/to/' ~ object.getId()" />
            <description property="body" />
            <image expr="'/assets/images/' ~ object.getType()" />
            <fields>
                <field name="title" type="string" />
                <field name="body" type="string" />
            </fields>

        </mapping>

    </massive-search-mapping>

Note:

- This file **MUST** be located in ``YourBundle/Resources/config/massive-search``
- It must be named after the name of your class (without the namespace) e.g.
  ``Product.xml``
- Your ``Product`` class MUST be located in one of the following folders:
  - ``YourBundle/Document``
  - ``YourBundle/Entity``
  - ``YourBundle/Model``

.. note::

    It will be possible in the future to specify paths for mapping files.

.. note:: 

    The bundle automatically removes existing documents with the same
    ID. The ID mapping is mandatory.
